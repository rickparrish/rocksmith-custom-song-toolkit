This is a fork of https://github.com/rscustom/rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit that adds a **songpacksplitter** app that, as the name implies, splits songpacks.

Splitting songpacks probably isn't too helpful for most people, but I use the split songs with my https://github.com/rickparrish/Rocksmith2014.Rearranger app,
which lets me rearrange bass/guitar arrangements for the ukulele.
